## React to the New York Times
This is a Full MERN application which allows users to query the New York Times API for articles filtered by date and title. The app will display the title, publication date, and URL to the user. Users may also save articles of interest; the application will record the date they saved the article, display it in a 'saved' section, and allow them to delete it if they so choose

## Motivation
This project was intended to incorporate all aspects of a Full Stack application. React.js is an incredibly powerful framework for building dynamic user interfaces which can be complented by a Node.js backend and Mongo Database. By incorporating all of these technologies, this project was  built to mimic production applications. 


## Code style
This project follows the Model-View-Controller architecture by sepearting the business logic of the application from the user interface. This allows for modulated code that is easier to maintain and significantly more scalable.
